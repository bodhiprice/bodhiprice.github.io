Hey there! A bit about me...I'm a software engineer and for the past few years I've been focused on building cloud-based applications on AWS. One of the things I plan on sharing here are some of the experiences my team has had moving to the cloud. In particular, we've focused on building serverless applications. However, the journey hasn't been a straight line. There have been a few detours along the way. But we're getting there! In fact, we're very close to another big step in this transformation. We're converting our React frontend to a multi-region, active-active, serverless architecture that runs off Node.js and Fastify. Pretty exciting stuff! I think the business reasons for this are pretty interesting as well. No doubt a lot of other teams are facing similar issues, so I'm looking forward to being able to share more soon. 

As I say in my bio, if you're working with a small team or non-profit and you want to chat about getting started with AWS — and serverless in particular — please reach out. I have a ton of experience in this area and would be happy to share! You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bodhiprice) or email me at [jprice@hey.com](mailto:jprice@hey.com).
